>### Theme of Marketing Video Backgrounds

  - Stacked printed bond paper incinerated from the bottom up
  - Large scale vinyl, bond paper, or sticker prints of various sizes on a 36 x 64 plate with a variety of sizes (probably in a Fibonacci pattern per plate in the scale of the reusable graphic)
  - Use covering sprays or various physical effects to film each use of the logo upon different substrates *(think different printing processes for t-shirt designs so they can be re-used for new items alongside each marketing campaign; i.e. black on black or glow in the dark)*

>### Equipment for shooting Marketing Videos

- Use phones as cameras for ease of use when shooting these materials in camera.

## *Concepts:*
>### *Kendrick stage performance adapted to FP:*
- Smoke machines using house lighting rig to automatically change to match video on screen based upon order of show (i.e. what's on the main screen is reflected in the lighting of the smoke coming from the stage left and right )
- Stage lights to accent LED via back lighting in sync with color settings
- Lights to color scenes in front of the stage (i.e., spotlights on producers) - single mapped source but back lit by LED and enhanced by house lights
